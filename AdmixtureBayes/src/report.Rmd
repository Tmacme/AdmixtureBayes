# MCMC results

The marginal distributions of collected statistics are

```{r}
files <- list.files(pattern = "*_distrub.png", path = 'plots')
for(fil in files){
  print(fil)
  print(knitr::include_graphics(paste('plots/',fil,sep='')))
}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
