The add admix proposal function were simulated from many times, the probability of each chosen sink-source was noted, and the resulting topological tree.

```{r}
tr=read.csv('results3.csv', header=F)
head(tr)
```

This shows that it is a proper distribution. 

```{r}
sum(tr[,7])
```

Here we test if the distribution matches:

```{r}
e=tr$V7*sum(tr$V8)
x=tr$V8
G=2*sum(x*log(x/e))
data.frame(chisq=G, pval=1-pchisq(G, length(x)-1))
```


But do any of them map to the same tree (which is not necessarily illegal)

```{r}
print(length(tr[,6]))
print(length(unique(tr[,6])))
```

Some maps to the same thing (but not as many as we would expect)

```{r}
tr[duplicated(tr[,6]),]
tr[duplicated(tr[,6], fromLast = T),]
```

```{r}

```
