The add admix proposal function were simulated from many times, the probability of each chosen sink-source was noted, and the resulting topological tree.

```{r}
tr=read.csv('results3.csv', header=F)
head(tr)
```

This shows that it is a proper distribution. 

```{r}
sum(tr[,6])
```

But do any of them map to the same tree (which is not necessarily illegal)

```{r}
print(length(tr[,5]))
print(length(unique(tr[,5])))
```

Some maps to the same thing (but not as many as we would expect)

```{r}
tr[c(duplicated(tr[,5]),duplicated(tr[,5], fromLast = T)),]
```
